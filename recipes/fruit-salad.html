  <h4>Fruit salad</h4>
  <p>This recipe shows you how to make fruit salad without the heavy, creamy fruit salad dressing that you’re used to
    seeing. It leaves plenty of room for all the flavors of the fruit to shine without drenching it in sugar and other
    random flavors.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strawberries – to select good strawberries it’s kind of a no brainer. They should have a nice red color, no dark
      spots, no mold, and check out the leaves – those green tops should look vibrant and fresh.</li>
    <li>Pineapple – to pick a good pineapple smell the bottom, it should have that sweet pineapple scent. To know when
      it’s ripe the skin should be turning yellow and it should have some give when pressed.</li>
    <li>Blueberries – I like those plump juicy blueberries here. They tend to be sweeter.</li>
    <li>Red grapes – to choose good grapes squeeze a couple of them, they should be firm and plump, they should also
      look tight and intact to the stems (not loose) and they should have a nice color.</li>
    <li>Kiwi – to select kiwi look for some that are fairly soft when pressed. Those that are firm are sour and unripe.
      Small or large size won’t matter.</li>
    <li>Mandarin oranges – I used to use canned mandarins here but I prefer fresh now. Either will work great. Mangoes
      work well as a substitute for the oranges.</li>
    <li>Bananas – these are optional. If you do add them just use yellow bananas. No green peel (not sweet enough) and
      no brown (too mushy).</li>
    <li>Honey – I don’t recommend substitutions for this unless there’s an allergy (if so I’d maybe try maple syrup or
      brown rice syrup).</li>
    <li>Limes – in a pinch lemons would work too.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare fruit: chop fruits (except blueberries) and add to a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Make dressing: in a small mixing bowl, whisk together they honey, lime zest and lime juice.</li>
    <li>Toss fruit with dressing: pour dressing over fruit just before serving and toss to evenly coat.</li>
  </ol>
